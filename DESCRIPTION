Description: This package contains a set of functions for manipulating and
    visualizing output from numerical ocean models. Many of the routines are
    targeted towards Lagrangian particle-tracking models with the data stored
    in NetCDF files. This package may be useful to spatial marine ecologists
    and biological or physical oceanographers.
